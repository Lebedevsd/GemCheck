```
GemCheck overlays a floating panel on poe.ninja's skill gem price page and
instantly tells you which transfigured gems are worth hunting at the
Labyrinth Divine Font.

─── HOW THE DIVINE FONT WORKS ───────────────────────────────────────────

The Divine Font offers two ways to transfigure a gem:

  Color Roll — insert any gem of a colour and receive a random transfigured
  gem from that colour's entire pool (equal chance for each gem in the pool).

  Specific Roll — insert a specific base gem and receive one of that gem's
  transfigured variants at random (equal chance per variant).

GemCheck calculates the expected value (EV) and hit probabilities for both
modes so you can make informed decisions before you run the lab.

─── FEATURES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  • Color Roll Bingo — for each colour (Red / Green / Blue) shows the top
    target gems with their hit probability and current sell price.

  • Best Specific Gems — a combined cross-colour ranking of all base gems
    sorted by EV, with every variant's probability and sell price listed.

  • Live pricing — pulls directly from poe.ninja's API for the current
    league. Data is cached for 5 minutes; a Refresh button busts the cache.

  • League auto-detection — reads the league from the poe.ninja URL, so it
    always shows data for the league you are browsing.

  • Draggable panel — reposition anywhere on screen; minimise or close when
    not needed.

  • Configurable Top N — choose how many gems to show per section (3 / 5 / 8).

─── USAGE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Navigate to poe.ninja › Economy › [your league] › Skill Gems.
The GemCheck panel appears automatically.

─── NOTES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  • Prices shown are raw sell prices (cheapest non-corrupted listing on
    poe.ninja). Base gem cost and lab fees are not deducted.
  • This extension only runs on poe.ninja. No data is collected, stored,
    or sent anywhere.
  • Gem pool data sourced from the Path of Exile wiki.
